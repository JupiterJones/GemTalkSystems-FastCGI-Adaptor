GemTalkSystems-FastCGI-Adaptor
==============================

A FastCGI Adaptor for GemStone on MacOSX 10.8 and 10.9 Server

This adaptor is for people using MacOSX Server (ie. NOT standard OSX but OSX with the Server package installed).

It allows the builtin apache 2 server to forward requests to Seaside via the GemStone Fast CGI Adaptor simply by selecting the GemStone checkbox from the Edit Advanced Settings dialog.

Installation
============

There is no package installer yet (I'll make one once I get a copy of 10.10).

Copy the files in dstroot to the same locations on OSX Server.

Any improvements would be much appreciated.

Have fun with the most capable application server on Earth - GemStone/Smalltalk
