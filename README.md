GemTalkSystems-FastCGI-Adaptor
==============================

A FastCGI Adaptor for GemStone on MacOSX 10.8 and 10.9 Server

This adaptor is for people using MacOSX Server (ie. NOT standard OSX but OSX with the Server package installed).

It allows the builtin apache 2 server to forward requests to Seaside via the GemStone Fast CGI Adaptor simply by selecting the GemStone checkbox from the Edit Advanced Settings dialog.
